A santa dog lived as a devil god at NASA.

A man, a plan, a cat, a ham, a yak, a yam, a hat, a canal-Panama!

A nut for a big jar of tuna.

Amy, must I jujitsu my ma?

Are we not pure? “No sir!” Panama’s moody Noriega brags. “It is garbage!” Irony dooms a man; a prisoner up to new era.

A new order begin, a more age bread Rowena.

Anne, I vote more cars race Rome to Vienna.

A santa dog lived as Ha devil god at NASA.
